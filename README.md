# Aionic: A Research Proposal for a Provable, Sustainable, and Credibly Neutral Blockchain

**Aionic** is a research proposal for a new class of Layer 1 blockchain that combines **stateless validation, recursive compression, verifiable storage markets, and epoch-level zero-knowledge proofs** into a single architecture.  

The vision is simple but ambitious:  
**a perpetually infinite ledger ‚Äî fast enough for global-scale adoption, provable enough to be trusted forever, and neutral enough to resist capture.**

## Overview

Current blockchain ecosystems face persistent trade-offs:  

- **Ethereum** emphasizes neutrality and security, but fragments into rollups with siloed liquidity and heavy light-client costs.  
- **Solana** emphasizes speed and user experience, but requires heavy validator hardware and relies on opaque indexing layers.  

**Aionic is proposed as a synthesis**:  

- Stateless validators (no state bloat).  
- Recursive Storage Objects (RSOs) for infinite, verifiable state.  
- Proof-carrying logs and zk epoch proofs for perpetual verifiability.  
- Shared-security extensions that scale without fragmenting liquidity.  
- Neutrality by design: single-token gas, open MEV auctions, no identity hooks in consensus.  

This repository serves as a home for the **Aionic research whitepaper** and related discussion. It is not a launch roadmap, but an exploration of how these primitives can be combined into a coherent system.

## Whitepaper

The paper describes each component in detail:  
- Execution Layer (EVM-compatible + stateless validation)  
- Recursive Storage Objects (RSOs)  
- Consensus and Proof Systems (zk epoch proofs, tripwire proofs, proof futures)  
- Storage Markets and Incentives (rent, storage NFTs, insurance pool)  
- MEV Neutrality and Governance (open builder auctions, bicameral checks)  
- Extensions and Scaling (shared-security under one root)  
- Security and Resilience (dual proof stacks, TimeCapsule anchors, bridge triangulation)  
- Potential Use Cases (proof-carrying social, zk-verified AI, verifiable audit logs, large-scale data apps)

## Prior Art and Research Timestamp

This repository and its whitepaper serve as a **public timestamp of prior art** for the architectural concepts described herein.  
The intent is to contribute to open blockchain research and provide a documented reference for these designs.
